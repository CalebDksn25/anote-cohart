Alex: Alright, let’s get started. First thing, we need to finalize the onboarding flow changes we discussed last week.

Priya: Yeah, I can take that. I’ll update the onboarding screens and share mocks by Friday.

Jordan: Cool. On the infra side, we’re still seeing some latency spikes. I think we should investigate caching options.

Sam: Are we assigning that now or just exploring?

Alex: Let’s assign it. Jordan, can you look into caching strategies and give us a recommendation by next Wednesday?

Jordan: Yep, sounds good.

Priya: Also, the customer feedback summary — I didn’t get to it yet.

Alex: Okay, can you finish that early next week?

Priya: Yes, I’ll send it out by Monday.

Sam: Quick note — we probably need to loop in design for the new dashboard, but that’s not urgent.

Alex: Agreed. Let’s park that for now.

Alex: One more thing: we should schedule a follow-up meeting once the onboarding mocks are ready.

Sam: I can set that up after Priya shares the mocks.

Alex: Perfect.

Alex: Anything else?

Jordan: No, that’s it.
